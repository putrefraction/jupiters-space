Things to write/find out:

- Learning to Unlearn: The Death of Ideas and how it Nurtures the land


Things I've understood: 
- Balance your resources for longevity, not for intensity 
  - Being able to do one thing per day for one year is better than doing ten things per day for one week
  - Question: How?
    - Balancing resource consumption with recovery, making it a non-consuming habit (impossible), better: making the consumption-recovery cycle mutually affirming and activating
    - Having fun with it!
- Surround yourself by people who support you in what you want to do 
  - Friends are the most powerful resource available to anyone. Friends who support you and bring you closer to your objectives are the most powerful resource available in existence.
  - In finding people who support you and getting them into your circle you avoid people who drag you down, diminishing the amount of effort you make policing yourself.
